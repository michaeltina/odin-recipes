    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Who doesn’t like a good one-pot dinner? I make them all the time because they are super easy, convenient, and quick to make.</p>

    <p>In this one-pot chicken and rice, mushrooms, shallots, garlic, chicken, wine, and seasonings are joined by white rice and green peas all in the same skillet. Complete your meal with a simple green or Caesar salad, and some crusty bread.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 teaspoon Italian herb seasoning blend</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>5 (8 ounce) boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided</li>
            <li>1 shallot, diced</li>
            <li>8 ounces sliced mushrooms</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1/2 cup dry sherry</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups chicken stock</li>
            <li>1 cup uncooked long grain white rice</li>
            <li>3 sprigs fresh thyme</li>
            <li>1/4 cup minced fresh parsley, divided</li>
            <li>2 cups frozen green peas, thawed</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir Italian seasoning, garlic powder, salt, and pepper together in a small bowl. Season pounded chicken with blended seasonings, and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add 1 tablespoon olive oil to a large skillet or Dutch oven over medium heat, and add 1 tablespoon butter.</li>
        <li>When butter is melted and oil is hot, cook shallot and mushrooms for about 3 minutes. Add garlic; cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Remove from the skillet and keep warm.</li>
        <li>To the same skillet, add remaining tablespoon each of oil and butter. When butter is melted and no longer sizzling, carefully add chicken and cook until browned, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Turn chicken over, and slowly add dry sherry. Cook about 2 minutes, to allow the alcohol to cook off.</li>
        <li>Add chicken stock, mushroom-shallot mixture, thyme sprigs, and 2 tablespoons parsley to the pan. Bring to a boil and stir in rice. Lift chicken so that it rests on top of the rice and vegetables. Cover, reduce heat, and cook for about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in peas, and stir rice from the edges of the pan into the center. Taste and season with salt and pepper, and cook until rice is tender, chicken is no longer pink at the center and juices run clear, about 5 minutes more. Remove pan from heat, and allow to stand, covered, about 5 minutes. An instant read thermometer inserted into the center of chicken should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Remove thyme sprigs, fluff rice with a fork, and garnish with reserved fresh minced parsley.</li>
    </ol>
